## Project Description ##
<img align="center" width="1000" height="" src="Result%20images/Images/System%20Design.png">

Recent advances in Machine Learning are pushing the boundaries of real world AI applications
and are becoming more and more integrated in our daily lives. As research
advances, the long-term goal of autonomous driving becomes rather reality than fiction,
but brings with it numerous challenges for our society and the system engineers.
Topics like ethical AI, privacy and transparency are becoming increasingly relevant
and have to be considered when designing AI systems with real world applications. In
this project we present our first attempt at tackling the problem of traffic sign recognition
by taking a systems engineering approach. We focus on the development of an
explainable and transparent system with the use of concept whitening layers inside our
deep learning models, which allow us to train our models with handcrafted features
and make predictions based on predefined concepts. We also introduce a simulation
environment for traffic sign recognition, which can be used for model deployment,
performance benchmarking, data generation and further domain model research.

## Simulation Instructions ##
### Download and Installation ###
To use the simulation, please download first the .zip folder from [this google drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19yk97jsQ0Bavtktzb-BuVcJ_DlsRyKAU/view?usp=sharing).
Once the download has finished, please extract the .zip folder. To start the simulation, please execute the file ```Simulation-based Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark.exe```, which is located inside the ```STSRB - Executable File``` folder.

### Main Menu Settings ###
**Graphical Settings:**  
```Post processing volume```  
```Quality Settings```  
```Terrain Detail Density```  
```Terrain Shape Quality```  

**Traffic Sign Settings:**    
```Traffic Sign Spawning Frequency``` Value between 0 and 1, which specifies the probability that a spawn point will contain a traffic sign (469 possible spawn points). Defines the proportion of traffic signs that are spawned within the scene.  
```Frequency of double Signs``` Value between 0 and 1, which specifies the probability that an active spawn point will contain two traffic signs. Defines the proportion of traffic sign poles that will contain two traffic signs.  
```Frequency of Rotation Variance``` Value between 0 and 1, which specifies the probability that an active traffic sign will contain some rotation around the z-axis. The rotation will be applied randomly in either direction to a maximum of 30Â°.  
```Frequency of occluded Signs``` Value between 0 and 1, which specifies the probability that an active traffic sign contains sticker objects on its surface. The algorithm spawn between 1 and 5 sticker objects and applies random scale, rotation and textures to the stickers.  

**Driving Modes:**   
```Autonomous Driving``` Makes the car follow a predefined path that was handmade.  
```Manual Driving``` Makes the car drivable by the user himself.  

**Generate Dataset:**  
```Generate Dataset``` If this checkbox is active, the simulation will be used to generate a dataset. Please specify a system path, where you want to store the dataset (e.g. C:\Users\alens\Desktop).  
```Image Width``` Specifies the width dimension for the generated dataset.  
```Image Height``` Specifies the height dimension for the generated dataset.  
```Screenshot rate``` Specifies the rate in seconds in which the simulation makes a screenshot of the environmental scene.  

**PRESS TO START:**  
Use this button to start the simulation.

**ACTIVE SIGNS:**  
Use this button to open a new menu window, where you can specify which traffic signs should be contained within the simulation.

### Ingame UI ###

```1``` Buttons to controll the turn signal lights.  
```2``` Weather dropdown with 5 available options: sunny day, rainy day, sunrise/sunset, bright night, dark night.  
```3``` Value between 0 and 1, which specifies the rain intensity.  
```4``` Camera icon, showing the current camera mode.  
```5``` Button to return to the main menu.  
```6``` Button to exit the simulation.  
```7``` Button to controll the headbeam lights.  
```8``` UI where the detected traffic signs will be displayed (not implemented yet).
