## Project Description ##
<img align="center" width="1000" height="" src="Result%20images/Images/Title%20Page.png">

Recent advances in Machine Learning are pushing the boundaries of real world AI applications
and are becoming more and more integrated in our daily lives. As research
advances, the long-term goal of autonomous driving becomes rather reality than fiction,
but brings with it numerous challenges for our society and the system engineers.
Topics like ethical AI, privacy and transparency are becoming increasingly relevant
and have to be considered when designing AI systems with real world applications. In
this project we present our first attempt at tackling the problem of traffic sign recognition
by taking a systems engineering approach. We focus on the development of an
explainable and transparent system with the use of concept whitening layers inside our
deep learning models, which allow us to train our models with handcrafted features
and make predictions based on predefined concepts. We also introduce a simulation
environment for traffic sign recognition, which can be used for model deployment,
performance benchmarking, data generation and further domain model research.

The project is still in development.
